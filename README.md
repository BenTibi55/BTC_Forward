This project predicts Bitcoin price volatility using a Random Forest regression model. It fetches historical data from Binance's API, calculates key features like moving averages, RSI, and lagged returns, and uses rolling volatility as the target variable. The model is optimized with GridSearchCV and evaluated using metrics like MAE and RÂ². Visualizations include feature importance, actual vs. predicted volatility, and volatility trends, providing insights into factors influencing Bitcoin's price movements.
